Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are vital components in network security, tasked with monitoring and identifying malicious activities. Traditional IDSs, often rule-based, face challenges in adapting to new attack vectors and maintaining effectiveness. This project proposes an IDS that employs Machine Learning (ML) techniques, specifically Smote with Random Forest algorithm, to enhance network security in imbalanced traffic environments. In imbalanced network traffic, malicious cyber-attacks can often hide in large amounts of normal data. It exhibits a high degree of stealth and obfuscation in cyberspace, making it difficult for Network Intrusion Detection System(NIDS) to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of detection.Hence, we proposed SMOTE algorithm with the PCA and RF for the accurate prediction of the sytem uncder attacked or not attacted. We get an accuracy of 97% using the algorithm.
